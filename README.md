## School Payment System
This was a side project to help reinforce the concepts of object oriented programming


## Description
This program was a CLI tuition payment portal for a student paying for classes. It reinforces the concept of encapsulation, getters and setters and constructors. The program prompts for a user to input how many students they want to enroll, input their names, their student year and their courses. Once everything is complete it will prompt how much money the student owes for tuition. It will also take in the payment and calculate it against the tuition.
